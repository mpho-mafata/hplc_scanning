# Introduction
This repository is very specific. It contains a nested dataset extracted from the instrument as .aia files. 
The batch files contained 301 .aia folders each containing five signals (four uv-vis and a fluorescence signal).
These data were generated using scanning gradient in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

# Data wrangling
I started by wrangling and unnesting the files into workable lists.

# Inspecting the chromatograms
Then next hurdle is plotting the chromatograms to see if everything is okay inside.

# Analysing the data
Next I will try and use multivariate statistics and clustering to decipher the data.
